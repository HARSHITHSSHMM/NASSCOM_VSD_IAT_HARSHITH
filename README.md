### Packaging:
Below is an image of an arduino board.<br/><br/>

* We can see a chip was marked in yellow circle.Its block diagram is as shown below.<br/><br/>

* The chip which was marked in yellow circle is the processor/SOC. Other are peripherals.<br/>
* But the misconception is that we consider whole chip as IC. But it is a 'package' and it looks as it is shown below. <br/><br/>

* It is a quad flat no-lead package.Some other types of packaging are shown below.<br/><br/>

![IC package](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/950e3aa3-c6c8-47f3-aa14-b09da67d6632)<br/><br/>

From above image =><br/>
-> BGA : Ball Grid Array<br/>
-> DIP : Dual Inline Package<br/>
-> QFN : Quad Flat No-Lead Package<br/>
-> QFP : Quad Flat Package<br/>
-> SOP : Small-outline Package<br/>
-> SOT : small outline transistor<br/>

* The Ic will be sitting at the centre of the package(chip) and the chip is "Wire Bound" as shown in the below image.<br/><br/>

* Now, we are going to see inside the chip.<br/><br/>

* As shown in the image,we can see 'pads', 'core' , 'die'.
-> PADS : These are used to complete interconnections between different chips or chip and the board.<br/>
-> Core : It is the area where the design exist.<br/>
-> Die  : It is the silicon wafer piece on which IC was fabricated.<br/>

* Below is an example of the chip we are discussing.<br/><br/>

### Foundry IPs:

* From above image, we can see some blocks that are mentioned as " Foundry IPs".<br/>
* IP means " Intellectual Property ".
* Foundry is the place where chips will be manufactured.Ex: TSMC,UMC etc.
