* We can see a chip was marked in yellow circle.Its block diagram is as shown below.<br/><br/>

* The chip which was marked in yellow circle is the processor/SOC. Other are peripherals.<br/>
* But the misconception is that we consider whole chip as IC. But it is a 'package' and it looks as it is shown below. <br/><br/>
